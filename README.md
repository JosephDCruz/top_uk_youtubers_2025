## Objective

### Key business problem
The Head of Marketing needs to identify the top-performing UK YouTubers in 2025 in order to determine which creators are best suited for marketing campaigns throughout the year.

Currently, there is no consolidated view that compares YouTube channels using consistent performance and engagement metrics, making it difficult to make data-driven collaboration decisions.

### Ideal solution
Create an interactive dashboard that provides insights into the **top UK YouTubers in 2025**, including:

- Subscriber count  
- Total video views  
- Total number of uploaded videos  
- Engagement metrics  

This dashboard will enable the marketing team to objectively evaluate creators and select YouTubers who are most likely to deliver effective and high-impact marketing campaigns.

## User Story

**As the Head of Marketing**,  
I want to use a dashboard that analyses YouTube channel data for creators based in the UK,  
so that I can identify the highest-performing YouTube channels using metrics such as subscriber count, total views, and engagement.

With these insights, I can make informed decisions about which YouTubers to collaborate with, maximising the effectiveness and return on investment of marketing campaigns in 2025.

## Data Source
### Data requirements
To achieve the project objective, the following data is required for **top UK YouTubers in 2025**:

- Channel name  
- Total subscriber count  
- Total video views  
- Total number of videos uploaded

### Data origin
The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle** and provided as an **Excel extract** containing aggregated YouTube channel statistics.

> 🔗 Dataset link: *[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavyadhingra00020/top-100-social-media-influencers-2024-countrywise?resource=download]*

This dataset enables analysis of channel size, reach, and engagement performance across UK-based creators.

## Stages
The project follows a structured analytics workflow to ensure clarity, accuracy, and reproducibility:

- **Design** – Define business questions and dashboard requirements  
- **Development** – Explore, clean, transform, and model the data  
- **Testing** – Validate data quality and metric accuracy  
- **Analysis** – Generate insights and validate findings

## Design
### Dashboard components required

To meet the business requirements, the dashboard must answer the following key questions:

1. Who are the **top 10 UK YouTubers** by subscriber count in 2025?  
2. Which **3 channels** have uploaded the most videos?  
3. Which **3 channels** have the highest total views?  
4. Which **3 channels** have the highest **average views per video**?  
5. Which **3 channels** have the highest **views-to-subscriber ratio**?  
6. Which **3 channels** show the highest **subscriber engagement per video uploaded**?

These questions may evolve as insights are discovered during the analysis phase.

### Mockup
#### Visuals considered
To effectively answer the business questions, the following visualisations are used:

1. Table (detailed channel comparison)  
2. Treemap (relative channel size by subscribers or views)  
3. Scorecards (headline KPIs)  
4. Horizontal bar charts (rankings and comparisons)  

These visuals are designed to be intuitive for non-technical stakeholders while supporting data-driven decision-making.
